This will contain my solutions to Project Euler questions using C or C++.
Ideally, I'll be able to benchmark some of these solutions with top-performing
Java and Python versions.

Note, to RUN a C program, here's what we can do. Write the C file which will
have the .c extension, e.g. pe001.c, and then we run the following:

clang pe001.c ; ./a.out 

The first command creates the executable file, a.out, which we then run using
./a.out.

An alternative to clang is using gcc, but clang is the default C (and C++)
compiler for Macs.
