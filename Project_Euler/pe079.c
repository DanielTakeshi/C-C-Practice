/**
 * PE 079: Passcode Derivation. I did this by hand since the problem is
 * fortunately easy enough (only 50 numbers). After scanning the file I observed
 * some patterns (e.g. 7 comes early, 0 comes last) and the key is to check
 * pairs of numbers to see which comes before/after. Fortunately only 8 digits
 * are needed (the problem could have easily been much harder) so no code is
 * necessary.
