/**
 * PE 026: Reciprocal Cycles. Looking back at my old notes, I actually did this
 * one by hand. Basically start at 1/999 and work down, and in this case it was
 * easy because the answer has a sequence which is of period d-1, and we know we
 * can stop there. Interesting, if we have 1/d, why is the length of the cycle
 * required to be <= d-1? AH, I see on the discussion forum. Nice.
